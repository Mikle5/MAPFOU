## Introduction

This project provides an unofficial implementation of the CEBC and CEWC algorithms as described in the paper [https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/27219/26992](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/27219/26992). It was developed as part of my academic studies.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- `cebc.ipynb`: Implementation of the CEBC algorithm.
- `cewc.ipynb`: Implementation of the CEWC algorithm.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used in the project.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample data for testing the algorithms.
- `data_generation.ipynb`: Generation of maps for testing.
